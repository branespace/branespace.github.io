The problem space is an 8x8 grid of squares.

The user selects a ship from a list, either Dart or Catamaran.

Certain squares may be used, and others may not be. The user makes a selection of one option out of 4 for each of the following categories:
1. Reactor
2. Auxiliary Generator A
3. Auxiliary Generator B

The reactor defines which squares are usable in the top 4 rows. Auxiliary Generator A defines the usable squares in rows 5 and 6, and Auxialiary Generator B defines usable squares in rows 7 and 8.

The user has categories of devices to select from:
1. Jump Drive
2. Sensors
3. Engine
4. Pilot Weapon A
5. Pilot Weapon B
6. Multi Turrets
7. Special Weapon A
8. Special Weapon B
Each category should also have a optional selection of priority, ranging from 0-7.

The Dart allows selection of categories 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
The Catamaran allows selection of categories 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8.

Each category will have 4 options, each of which represents a shape made of contiguous squares. 
Once the user has selected one shape from each category, the application should display a graphical represetnation of how the shapes can optimally fit within the grid.

Use the following rules for placement on the grid:
1. Only squares defined as available by the slected Reactor and Auxiliary Generator A and B may be occupied.
2. No square may have 2 devices occupyign it.
3. Devices with higher priority (lower number) should be placed on protected squares (defined by the Reactor and Auxiliary Generator A and B)
4. Display the devices with names and different colors to make them easy to distinguish.

For each category, create a separate script file to hold the different shapes. Create 4 shapes each, as defined below:
